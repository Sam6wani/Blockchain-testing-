We identified Oyente, an open-source tool compatible with Ethereum simulator platforms (docker pull luongnguyen/oyente), through extensive searches in online digital libraries like GitHub and ACM.
Applied Oyente’s symbolic execution to analyse smart contract bytecode and the Ethereum global state, detecting bugs in deployed contracts by emulating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution model.
Utilised XBlock-ETH, which processes and simplifies a rich dataset of 8.1 million blocks from Ethereum, making it suitable for direct analysis. This dataset addresses the challenges of synchronising and analysing Ethereum’s complex and heterogeneous open-source data.
Created an automated test environment, we installed and configured blockchain test nodes Geth and Parity, along with libraries such as web3.js, Ether.js, Web3.py, and solc 5.0.
Obtained a Benchmark Dataset that labels programs based on their correct or incorrect usage of security APIs, providing an evaluation dataset for Application Security Testing tools.
For Oyente’s performance analysis, I tested the detector tools against known vulnerabilities in controlled environments, comparing the results to industry standards and benchmarks. Following this, I evaluated the tools using metrics like precision, recall, F-score, and false positive rate.
